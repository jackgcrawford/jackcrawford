This report was published to support expert discussions at the Expert Group Meeting on First and Last Mile Access to Public Transport in Asia and the Pacific, hosted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) on 20 June 2024. Public transport plays a critical role in fostering sustainable and inclusive mobility, yet gaps in first and last mile (FLM) access hinder the full realization of these benefits. The report explores key factors influencing FLM accessibility in the region, including infrastructure, socio-economic factors, mode-specific features, and safety concerns. It highlights the challenges faced in urban and transport planning, financing, and the integration of informal transport services, while also pointing to emerging opportunities such as micromobility solutions. By examining these issues, the report provides valuable insights and policy recommendations to guide the development of more inclusive, accessible, and sustainable public transport systems across Asia and the Pacific.
