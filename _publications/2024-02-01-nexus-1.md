This policy brief, Pathways to Sustainable Development: The Nexus of Transport, Energy, and Urban Planning in Asia and the Pacific, explores the critical interconnections between these sectors in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 and 11. In the dynamic context of Asia and the Pacific, characterized by rapid urbanization, escalating energy demands, and high motorization rates, it underscores the importance of sectoral integration for sustainable development. Key challenges include accelerating decarbonization while addressing socio-spatial inequalities, infrastructure gaps, and the reliance on fossil fuels. By highlighting case studies from Fiji and India, as well as structured approaches like the Avoid-Shift-Improve framework, the brief emphasizes the need for localized SDG implementation, political commitment, and cross-sectoral collaboration. Recommendations focus on equitable access, low-carbon technologies, and the integration of sustainable transport systems with energy and urban planning to foster inclusive and resilient urban ecosystems.
