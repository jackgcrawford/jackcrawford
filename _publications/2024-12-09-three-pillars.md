The policy brief on the "Three Pillars of Livable Cities in the Asia-Pacific" explores the interconnectedness
of health, road safety, and urban mobility in the context of the Asia-Pacific region. It emphasizes the need
for sustainable urban transport measures to address the challenges posed by rapid urbanization,
including air and noise pollution, road safety, and the disproportionate impact of road traffic crashes on
vulnerable road users. The document underscores the importance of political will and leadership in
implementing measures to improve health in urban settings and introduces concepts for creating
cohesive, integrated approaches to transport within cities.

Transport has been a significant contributor to negative externalities in urban areas, particularly in the
form of air pollution, which has detrimental effects on health. The traditional approach to transport
planning, which prioritized physical movement and convenience, has led to increased congestion and
pollution levels in urban areas. However, transport also presents opportunities for improving urban
landscapes, such as promoting the use of active transport modes, which reduce traffic congestion and
pollution, while also significantly improving physical and mental health. By prioritizing walking, cycling,
and public transport, urban planning can foster social equity and inclusion, provide low-cost travel
options and mitigate the impact of climate-related risks on marginalized communities.

The brief highlights the significance of sustainable urban mobility in supporting the attainment of the
people-centered goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It discusses the role of the
Avoid-Shift-Improve framework and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans in promoting sustainable urban
transport and emphasizes the importance of holistic approaches to policy decisions. In doing so, the
document outlines a four-phase approach to sustainable urban mobility planning which underscores the
need for collaboration among stakeholders and the development of specific actions and responsibilities
to ensure accountability for planned measures. Building on these concepts, the policy brief also
leverages the Sustainable Urban Transport Index, which was developed by ESCAP as a framework for
measuring sustainable transport metrics across cities in Asia and the Pacific. Case studies are provided
to illustrate the effectiveness of implementing sustainable urban transport measures to improve health in
urban settings.

The way forward underscores the critical importance of embedding people-oriented development
concepts, such as the Avoid-Shift-Improve framework, to overcome political resistance to sustainable
transport measures. The need for strong political commitment to transport policies and planning is also
emphasized, as well as the promotion of low carbon transport and active transport modes to achieve
sustainable urban mobility and to improve health in urban settings. The significance of fostering an
inclusive and equitable transport ecosystem that benefits the health of all urban residents is also raised.
