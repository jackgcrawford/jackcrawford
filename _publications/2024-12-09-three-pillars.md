The policy brief Three Pillars of Livable Cities in the Asia-Pacific explores the critical nexus of health, road safety, and urban mobility, emphasizing the need for sustainable transport measures to address challenges such as pollution, road traffic injuries, and social inequities exacerbated by rapid urbanization. It highlights the shift from traditional transport planning to integrated approaches that promote active transport modes, public transit, and inclusive urban mobility solutions. Leveraging frameworks like Avoid-Shift-Improve and ESCAP's Sustainable Urban Transport Index (SUTI), the brief outlines a collaborative, phased approach to sustainable urban mobility planning. By embedding people-centered policies and fostering political commitment, it underscores the transformative potential of sustainable transport to improve public health, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance equity and resilience in Asia-Pacific cities.
