The policy brief Accelerating Electric Mobility in Public Transport: Unlocking Financing for Electric Buses in Asia and the Pacific addresses the urgent need for sustainable solutions to the region's surging passenger transport demand. As rapid growth strains infrastructure and exacerbates emissions, congestion, and air pollution, electric buses offer a transformative pathway to shift from private to public transport and enhance environmental sustainability. However, financing their widespread adoption remains a major challenge, hindered by high upfront costs, technical uncertainties, and limited national policies for low-carbon transport. The brief explores existing and emerging financial mechanisms, such as government subsidies, innovative business models, and low-cost investment capital, while presenting case studies from the region that illustrate successful financing methods. It also highlights strategies like demand aggregation and leveraging third-parties to overcome barriers and scale adoption. It underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and technology advancements, while showcasing initiatives like ESCAPâ€™s Asia-Pacific Initiative on Electric Mobility as pivotal to fostering regional cooperation for a sustainable transport future.
