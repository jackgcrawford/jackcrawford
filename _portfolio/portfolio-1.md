Taken from the University of Nottingham on 20.10.2024, available at: (https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/careers/2024/08/13/from-nottingham-to-the-un-in-thailand-and-a-phd-in-japan/)

Born and raised in Nottingham, I studied BSc Management with a Placement Year at the University of Nottingham from 2017 to 2022.

My cherished memories there span childhood adventures on Highfields Park to graduating in the same spot two decades later. This deep-rooted connection to my hometown might give the impression that I never intended to venture far.

However, as I write this blog while balancing my time between my role in Economic Affairs at the United Nations in Thailand and my master’s and upcoming PhD in Economics at Kyoto University, Japan, I have always aspired towards an international career.

Experiences in Tanzania and Malaysia

My passion for international development was sparked in the summer of my first year at Nottingham, as I volunteered in Tanzania for three months to improve educational outcomes for children.

In my second year, I studied abroad in Malaysia for 12 months, where I immersed myself in diverse cultures and deepened my understanding of regional development challenges.

These experiences laid the foundational skills that I apply at the United Nations, where I contribute to shaping development policies in Asia and the Pacific.

Studying for a master’s in Japan

You might wonder how I transitioned from Nottingham to roles in Japan and Thailand and how these opportunities unfolded.

After returning from Malaysia to the UK, I knew my connection with Asia was only beginning. I started to search for postgraduate opportunities abroad and was offered a scholarship by the Government of Japan, having visited and fallen in love with the country when I studied abroad.

By September 2022, I had enrolled in a master’s degree in Economics at Kyoto University, and eight months later, in May 2023, I moved to Bangkok to pursue an Economic Affairs internship at the United Nations for six months. I was provided an opportunity to remain onboard after this, privileged and inspired by the chance to support far-reaching and positive global impact.

To support this role, I will start a PhD in Asian Sustainable Development Economics at Kyoto University in September 2024.

Overcoming challenges

Pursuing a career abroad is incredibly enriching, but it comes with its challenges. Therefore, I would like to leave you with some advice based on my own experiences.

The barriers to landing an international role straight out of university are considerable, but they should not deter you. Language barriers, visa requirements, the cost of moving, and the competitiveness of these positions against local applicants mean that many graduates spend years acquiring the skills and experience at home before moving.

These roles require substantial preparation, but you can start that now. Take every opportunity at university to go abroad, through summer schools, internships, or study abroad exchanges. These experiences show your ability to adapt to new environments and also allow you to build a global network that could prove beneficial when starting your international career.

Building on your time at Nottingham

If you have not already noticed, your time at university will fly by. For those of you starting, it can feel like one week you are at Fresher’s, and the next, you are deciding whether to sign a lease on a house in Lenton or study abroad in Ningbo.

For those graduating, I am sure you will have experienced all of this and more. Securing a career abroad is often years in the making, but embarking on this journey involves building upon the foundational skills you are demonstrating today, such as strategic planning and forward-thinking.

Use the momentum you have now (or what is left of it after exam season) to identify organisations you are passionate about, understand their hiring cycles, which may differ from the UK, and anticipate the skills needed for the specific country you aim to work in.

If you are keen to progress your career in another country, talk to a careers adviser about how to build your skills while in Nottingham and use our resources to explore opportunities overseas.
