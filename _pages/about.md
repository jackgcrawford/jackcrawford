Jack Crawford works in Economic Affairs for Transport Research & Policy in the Transport Division of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), based in Bangkok, Thailand, and holds a master’s degree in East Asian Sustainable Economic Development from Kyoto University, Japan, where his thesis focused on socio-technical transitions to electric vehicles in Asia and the Pacific. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Development Economics at Kyoto University, where he is conducting research on the socio-economic impacts of electric mobility in the region.

Jack covers three of ESCAP’s thematic areas in transport, focusing on urban mobility, low-carbon mobility, and inclusive transport. He provides technical assistance and capacity-building support to member States on the transition to electric mobility in public transport and enhancing first-and last-mile access to public transport. Jack’s interest lies at the intersection of these themes, where he promotes the use of low-carbon mobility to address transport challenges, particularly around gender equality and social inclusion, to ensure that transport solutions are inclusive and equitable.
