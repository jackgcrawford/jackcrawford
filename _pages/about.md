Jack Crawford works in Economic Affairs for Transport Research & Policy in the Transport Division of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), based in Bangkok, Thailand.

Jack covers three of ESCAP’s thematic areas in transport, focusing on urban mobility, low-carbon mobility, and inclusive transport. He provides technical assistance and capacity-building support to member States on the transition to electric mobility in public transport and enhancing first-and last-mile access to public transport. Jack’s interest lies at the intersection of these themes, where he promotes the use of low-carbon mobility to address transport challenges, particularly around gender equality and social inclusion, to ensure that transport solutions are inclusive and equitable.

Jack currently supports an ESCAP capacity-building project which aims to deploy electric bus pilot projects in four countries across Asia and the Pacific. He has authored several ESCAP publications, including a policy brief on “The Nexus of Transport, Energy, and Urban Planning in Asia and the Pacific,” produced in collaboration with ESCAP’s Energy Division and published as a key outcome of the ESCAP Executive Secretary’s visit to the UN High-Level Political Forum in 2023. These experiences have equipped him with a deep understanding of electric mobility transitions, encompassing high-level policy formulation through to on-the-ground implementation.

Jack holds a master’s degree in East Asian Sustainable Economic Development from Kyoto University, where his thesis focused on socio-technical transitions to electric vehicles in Asia and the Pacific. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Development Economics at Kyoto University, where he is conducting research on the socio-economic impacts of electric mobility in the region.
